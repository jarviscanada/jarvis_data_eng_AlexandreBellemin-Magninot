  # Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
  # What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: As a recent double-degree graduate with a Master's degree in Information Technology from ÉTS Montréal and a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from INSA Lyon, I bring a hybrid profile that combines data engineering, software development, and project coordination. I have applied technologies such as SQL, Python (Pandas/NumPy), RDBMS, Azure, Power BI, Java, VBA, Docker, and Git to design automated ETL pipelines, develop analytical dashboards, optimise workflows, and deploy cloud applications.
  As a Data Consultant at Thélio, I designed medallion architecture pipelines with Azure Data Factory and SQL stored procedures, extracted data via APIs, and created interactive dashboards in Power BI. At Bombardier, as a Project Coordinator, I enhanced governance, workflow optimisation, and cross-functional collaboration, delivering automation tools that improved data reliability and reduced process times from one week to a few minutes.
  I aim to solve data challenges, improve processes, and develop impactful data solutions to enhance my skills as a data engineer.

    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and the technologies you used(e.g., programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Developed a lightweight Linux monitoring solution that collects hardware specifications and real-time system metrics across multiple distributed servers. Built using Bash for data collection, PostgreSQL containerized with Docker as RDBMS, and cron jobs for automated ingestion. The project demonstrates how to design a simple DevOps-style data pipeline for capacity planning and system observability."
  - name: "Retail Analytics & Customer Segmentation PoC."
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: "Designed and implemented a complete analytics workflow for a simulated e-commerce company to help understand customer behavior and revenue sources. Built a reproducible environment using Docker, PostgreSQL, and Jupyter notebook. Performed data cleaning and transformations, exploratory analysis, KPI monitoring (monthly sales revenue/growth, number of new and existing customers...), and RFM segmentation using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Identified key customer segments, retention risks, and growth opportunities. This project strengthened my data engineering foundations (pipelines, ETL, database setup) and my ability to translate raw data into actionable business insights."
