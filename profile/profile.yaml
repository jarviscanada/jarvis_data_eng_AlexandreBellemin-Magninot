summary: As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Information Technology from the École de Technologie Supérieure de Montréal (ÉTS, Canada), with a double degree from the Institut Nationale des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon (INSA Lyon, France), I am interested in data, project management, and exploring new skills, with a particular focus on the aerospace and aeronautics sector. My goal is to build, learn, collaborate, understand, and above all, contribute to meaningful projects.

# List of Jarvis projects

  - name: "Linux Cluster Monitor."
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and the technologies you used(e.g., programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Implemented a lightweight Linux monitoring agent that gathers hardware specifications and real-time usage metrics of systems in a distributed environment, so you can keep an eye on your servers without having to htop every five minutes across your entire system. It uses Bash scripts to collect host information and real-time usage metrics, Git to facilitate teamwork and feature development, and Docker to run a PostgreSQL instance for a relational database. The collected data is automatically added to them using cron jobs, tracking CPU, memory, and disk usage for capacity planning, troubleshooting, or simply spying in a distributed system. Long story short, the project shows how to build a simple, efficient DevOps pipeline with just a few scripts and some container magic."
  - name: "RDBMS and SQL."
    git_url: "/sql"
    description: "Practiced SQL by writing almost 30 query exercises. They cover major SQL concepts, including DDL, joins, aggregations, window functions, and date and string manipulations. All the queries have been designed to be executed in a PostgreSQL database, created by DDL queries, and deployed in a Docker container."
